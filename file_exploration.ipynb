Under the FY’21 House Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, the House provided supplemental funding of an additional $730 million.  Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), $3.1 billion was provided.  The minimum level of funding necessary to address the base program would be $3.1 billion.  In addition, additional functions would require additional funding, including, but not limited to:  a) $18 billion for the SEP component of the “Open Back Better” bill from Rep. Blunt Rochester and Senator Smith (HR 7303/S. 4060 – also included in HR 2 and HR 4447), focusing on resiliency, energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades for mission-critical facilities (schools, hospitals, etc.); b) $500 million/year for 5 years for a proposal from Rep. Tonko to expand the NY “flex-tech” program to assist domestic manufacturers to retool and become more competitive and more energy efficient; c) Stabenow/Schumer proposal to expand state-level transportation planning to address “holistic” approaches to EVs and clean transportation - $50 million/year for 5 years; and d) Welch proposal to expand energy service performance contracting at the state and local level - $100 million/year for 5 years. This list does not include funding for the “Hope for HOMES and HOMES bills that would work through the state energy offices (Welch/McKinley), which we strongly support. In order to be most effective, we recommend that programs be expanded and allow spending to occur over 10 years in order to stimulate job growth and preservation, and jump-start the clean-energy economy.',\n",

This could be the “Open Back Better” bill noted above, which is set forth in authorizing legislation, but could also be streamlined in a stimulus bill like ARRA and converted into appropriations language.  If the total price tag of the legislation is deemed too high for the Senate, the focus on resilience investments (with energy efficiency, renewable energy and smart technologies) could be coupled with pre-disaster mitigation planning money pursuant to the Disaster Recovery and Reform Act (DRRA) and state and local capital improvements.  While it would be critical to have a 10-year horizon in such an effort, in order to create and maintain job growth and clean jobs, a smaller version could be for a shorter period and could focus on reducing energy consumption of state and local facilities by 20%.  There are literally hundreds of examples of these types of Energy Service Performance Contracting (ESPC) programs operational across the country (see, e.g., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory data base). These successful private financing programs have operated across both blue and red states (see, e.g., Texas “LoanStar” program - $600+ million in energy efficiency investments with zero defaults; or Nebraska “HELP” program – over $350 million in energy efficiency and renewable energy investments with less than $200,000 in defaults).  The additional innovation is connecting it to resilience activities. This program could be effective at less than the $18 billion for SEP from the Blunt-Rochester bill, but in order to have a fully transformative impact the highest number possible would be advisable.  The existing ESPC programs are in the $5-7 billion range annually, and are generally managed/supervised by the state energy offices, who also utilize the SEP funding.  Every state has a state energy office, and there are approximately 3000+ state energy officials across the United States.',\n",
       "              'Green Hydrogen – Long duration storage and decarbonization of the natural gas sector could occur with this new and innovative program.  To start, a state-utility roadmapping exercise could develop market-guiding policy recommendations that utilize excess renewable energy to produce green hydrogen to deliver clean peak grid support and injection (up to 10%) of green hydrogen into the existing natural gas system.  This is geared toward both single state analytical (economic, environmental, energy) and policy development activities, as well as a requirement for multi-state/regional collaborative activities.  Funding of about $50 million for three years “ be a good start.',\n",
       "              'Residential Green Construction Apprentices – One of our critical failings as a country, is not working hard enough to expand “green jobs” programs, especially in hard-hit communities across the U.S.  Public-private partnership programs designed to train unskilled workers (equity should be a key) for various construction trades, including apprentice-track trades (e.g., electrical and plumbing), could utilize advanced, commercially available building materials; training proper air sealing and insulation, etc.  Training in partnership with builders committed to ENERGY STAR or similar new construction with wage incentives should be the baseline.  This program could also be linked to building code compliance training, including especially building energy code compliance training.  The goal would be to train at least 100,000 workers over three years.  The program should be developed in conjunction with the Buildings Technology Office (BTO) of the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy division at DOE.  They could develop a model that states could adapt.  This would also be consistent with the “Green Jobs” legislation sponsored by Rep. Rush (D-IL) and Rep. Upton (R-MI).  Energy jobs data is based on the work of the US Energy and Employment Report (USEER) and E4theFuture.  This could also be utilized in conjunction with Rep. Welch’s “Hope for HOMES” and “HOMES” legislation.  At least $1 billion/year for three years should be dedicated to this effort.',\n",
       "              'Existing Home Retrofit Incentives tied to the Home Energy Score for all homes, with a special program for affordable/low-income housing (two parts) – a) State Existing Home Retrofit Incentives linked to Home Energy Score  ((HES) .  State programs utilize HES would identify energy efficiency measures in recently purchase homes with federal funding to pay for 75% of HES cost and 25% to be covered by local contractors or major retailers/product providers (e.g., Home Depot) – a public-private partnership intended to move to a large scale and self-sustaining market over the period of the funding.  This program could be linked to residential retrofit tax incentives, for ENERGY STAR products, including insulation. b) The same program could be adapted for use in the affordable housing/low-income housing sector where HES results in an HES-type building label (cost should be covered by federal funding) and covers the cost of the energy efficiency measures.  The label provides very modest “equity” value for the low-income homeowner.  The obvious linkage here is with the Low-Income Weatherization Assistance Program, but the DOE rules are restrictive, so this should be a separate activity.  However, funds provided from the LIHEAP program (up to 15% of LIHEAP funds without a waiver can be shifted to weatherization-type activities, though they are not limited by the specific DOE rules).  The HES cost is approximately $300/home ($300 million/year for 1 million homes/year = $900 million + funding support for the actual measures at $3 billion/year for 3 years = $9 billion).'],\n",
       "             'Economic Benefits': ['A study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory determined that under SEP for every federal dollar invested over $7 in energy savings is produced.  Again, this focused just on energy savings, and did not address the myriad of other economic benefits.  That same study determined that for every federal dollar, over $11 in non-federal funds are leveraged.  Obviously, if one extrapolates from the funding set forth in the prior sentence, then the economic benefits would be substantial, and would not be delayed by creating a new program.'],\n",
       "             'Job Creation': ['Assuming that 9.5 – 10 job years are created for every $1 million in SEP related activities (see analyses of Don Gilligan (NAESCO), Tim Unruh (former Federal Energy Management Program and NASESCO Executive Director) and the work of the US Energy and Employment Report (BW Research, EFI, NASEO), then the $3.1 billion for the ARRA-level SEP funding under a new stimulus bill would create an addition 31,000 jobs.  For the $18 billion under the “Open Back Better” bill (see HR 7303/S. 4060), which is projected to produce $110 billion in economic activity (1/2 manufacturing, ¼ local contracting work and ¼ other work), such a dramatic funding level would produce 1.1 million additional jobs.  You can extrapolate job creation from the other categories of funding set forth above.'],\n",
       "             'Environmental Benefits': ['Over the years, individual state programs have evaluated reductions in criteria pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions from state programs.  Depending on the level of funding, the environmental benefits would be enormous for both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions.  With 38% of energy use attributable to buildings, the reductions in energy use will be substantial.  In addition, if a robust EV program is coupled with a targeted greenhouse gas emissions program/hydrogen program, then an even larger emissions reduction could be generated.'],\n",
